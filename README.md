# BasicNumGuess
This is a very basic script that runs a number guessing game in Java.

This is one of my first smaller projects in Java and there will hopefully be more to come :)

I have been learning Java in my lectures and labs in my first year of my degree and this was one of the questions from the lab, that has been taken a little bit further 

Makes use of scanners to detect user inputs from the terminal as well as "if", "else if", "else" and "for" statements which I have been learning.
